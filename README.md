OFFICIALLY DEPRECATED

This functionality has now been integrated into [idris-vim](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-vim).  This repository will not receive updates and will only remain for compatibility purposes.

Vim-IdrisConceal
================

![Example image](http://i.imgur.com/vBdQey5.png)

This is a few modifications on https://github.com/Twinside/vim-haskellConceal that I use for working with idris in vim.  It should replace text with nicer-looking unicode characters when applicable, making your code look all pretty and math-like.  An example of the changes this makes is above.  To install this you can either install the included idris.vim file to ~/.vim/after/syntax or just point your favorite package manager at this repo.
