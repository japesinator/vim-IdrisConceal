Vim-IdrisConceal
================

This is a few modifications on https://github.com/Twinside/vim-haskellConceal that I use for working with idris in vim.  It should replace text with nicer-looking unicode characters when applicable, making your code look all pretty and math-like.  To install this you can either install the included idris.vim file to ~/.vim/after/syntax or just point your favorite package manager at this repo.
